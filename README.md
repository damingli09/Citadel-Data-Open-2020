# Citadel-Data-Open-2020-Fall
Report for the Citadel East Coast Regional Datathon (2020 Fall) 

Team members: Sheridan Green, Daming Li, Grant Schumacher, Youyuan Zhang

Won 3rd place out of 41 teams.

The pdf file is the final report. Some of my scripts/notebooks are uploaded in the Scripts folder (kind of messy), while the datasets could not be shared as part of the competition rule (similar ones can be found on Kaggle).

Techniques leveraged: regression, time series, causal inference, clustering analysis
